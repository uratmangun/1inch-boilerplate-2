# Introduction

History API allows you to access accurate transaction history data across several major networks. With it, you can get such information as:

- Transaction type, hash, status, fee, timestamps
- Participants addresses
- Token transfers, and more

## Use cases

The History API can be applied across various industries and scenarios that require access to accurate on-chain transaction data. Below are some common use cases:

### Compliance and auditing

The History API enables companies to access transaction details, including participants, amounts, and timestamps, helping them meet auditing requirements and adhere to Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations.

### Portfolio management

Investors and portfolio managers can use the History API to analyze transaction histories across multiple blockchain networks. It helps track token movements, swaps, staking activities, and liquidity provisions, allowing your users to generate reports and optimize investment strategies.

### DeFi protocol analytics

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols rely on transaction data to monitor user behavior, liquidity, and protocol usage. The History API provides detailed information on liquidity additions, removals, borrowing, lending, and staking activities, making it essential for DeFi analytics platforms.

### NFT marketplaces

NFT marketplaces can integrate the History API to display detailed transaction histories for NFTs, including purchases, bids, sales, and transfers. This enables buyers and sellers to review historical data before making decisions.

### Security and risk management

Security platforms can use the History API to track transaction histories and identify suspicious activities, such as unauthorized approvals or large token transfers. The API's detailed breakdown of transaction types helps detect patterns indicative of potential security threats, protecting users from fraud and malicious actions.

### Enterprise resource management

Enterprises engaging in blockchain transactions can integrate the History API to manage internal operations and resources more effectively. It helps track employee or system-triggered transactions, manage smart contract interactions, and ensure transparency in decentralized workflows.

### Tax reporting

Individuals and businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies must track all transactions for accurate tax reporting. The History API allows users to retrieve transaction histories to calculate gains, losses, and taxable events such as token swaps and sales.
