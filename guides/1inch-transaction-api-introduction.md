# Introduction

The Transaction Gateway API provides reliable on-chain transaction broadcasting, supporting both public and private modes. This enables developers to choose the most appropriate broadcasting method for their use case, whether for general public transactions or for sensitive, protected transactions in a private mempool. Ideal for applications focused on security and efficiency, the Transaction Gateway API is a powerful tool for wallets, exchanges, and virtually any on-chain application.

- **Reliable performance**: ensures robust transaction delivery, even under high-volume scenarios, making it suitable for fast-paced trading environments.

## Integration possibilities

- Wallets
