# Introduction

Get expanded data on users' NFTs.

The NFT API is designed to meet the needs of NFT platform developers and provides direct streamlined access to on-chain vital NFT data. With a simple GET request, retrieve comprehensive information about any NFT—whether it's pixel art, a meme, or a unique collectible.

Using just an NFT owner's address, developers can access detailed attributes of their assets, including image URLs, descriptions, associated contract details, and links to platforms like OpenSea. Queries can be customized with parameters like 'limit' and 'offset' to fit a variety of use cases, from lightweight data visualization to in-depth analytics.

As NFTs continue to gain prominence as digital art, collectibles, and even financial assets, having an efficient way to interact with and retrieve data about them is crucial. Whether you're building an NFT marketplace, a personal collection tracker, or a digital art gallery, our NFT API is the ideal foundation to start.

## Supported networks

- **Efficient querying**: customize requests with parameters like `limit` and `offset` to ensure seamless data retrieval, whether for simple lists or complex analyses.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: direct links to platforms like OpenSea make it easy to integrate NFT data across different marketplaces and applications.
- **Optimized for large datasets**: designed to handle significant query volumes, ensuring stable performance even for high-traffic applications.

## Integration possibilities

The NFT API can be integrated into various applications, making it highly versatile for different NFT-centric use cases. It is especially valuable for:

- NFT marketplaces
- Personal NFT collection trackers
