Structured conversations around feature specifications with clear requirements, design decisions, and implementation tasks. Kiro generated complete React components, TypeScript interfaces, API integrations, and deployment configurations. Most impressive: generated entire balance checker component with 1inch API integration, error handling, and responsive UI in single conversation. Key pattern: spec-first approach with iterative refinement through focused prompts.
