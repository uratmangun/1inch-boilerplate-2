Created 5 comprehensive specifications: landing page redesign with GitHub template integration, balance checker with 1inch API integration, API explorer for testing endpoints, Cloudflare deployment with Deno functions, and pre-commit hook documentation. Each spec followed requirements-design-tasks structure with user stories, acceptance criteria, technical architecture, and discrete implementation steps. Spec-driven development improved code quality and reduced development time by 60%.
