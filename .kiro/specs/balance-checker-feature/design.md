# Balance Checker Feature Design

## Architecture Overview
The Balance Checker Feature implements a client-side routing system using React Router to create a multi-page experience within the 1inch-boilerplate template. The architecture follows a component-based design with clear separation of concerns between the homepage and balance checking functionality.

## Technical Approach
The implementation uses React Router DOM for navigation, maintaining the existing shadcn/ui design system and Tailwind CSS styling. The feature is built as separate page components that integrate seamlessly with the existing ThemeProvider and StagewiseToolbar infrastructure.

## Component Design

### App Component (Router Container)
- **Purpose**: Main application container that provides routing infrastructure
- **Dependencies**: React Router, ThemeProvider, StagewiseToolbar
- **Interface**: Renders Routes with HomePage and BalancePage components
- **Key Features**: 
  - Wraps application in Router context
  - Maintains existing theme and toolbar functionality
  - Provides clean routing structure

### HomePage Component
- **Purpose**: Landing page component extracted from original App.tsx
- **Dependencies**: shadcn/ui components, Lucide React icons, React Router Link
- **Interface**: Displays hero section, repository instructions, and features grid
- **Key Features**:
  - Contains the "Check Balance" button with navigation to /balance route
  - Maintains all original homepage functionality
  - Implements responsive design with dark mode support

### BalancePage Component
- **Purpose**: Mock DeFi portfolio balance interface
- **Dependencies**: shadcn/ui components, React hooks (useState), React Router Link
- **Interface**: Interactive balance checking interface with mock data
- **Key Features**:
  - Total portfolio value display with aggregation
  - Individual token balance cards with real-time updates
  - Mock transaction history
  - Refresh functionality with loading states
  - Back navigation to homepage

## Data Flow

### Navigation Flow
1. User loads application → App component renders HomePage at "/" route
2. User clicks "Check Balance" button → React Router navigates to "/balance"
3. BalancePage component mounts → Displays mock balance data
4. User clicks "Back to Home" → React Router navigates back to "/"

### Balance Update Flow
1. User clicks refresh button → setIsLoading(true) triggers loading state
2. setTimeout simulates API call → Mock data generation with random fluctuations
3. setBalances updates state → UI re-renders with new values and trend indicators
4. setIsLoading(false) → Loading state cleared, interface becomes interactive

### State Management
- **Local State**: Each component manages its own state using React hooks
- **Balance Data**: Mock data stored in component state with simulated updates
- **Loading States**: Boolean flags for interactive feedback during refresh operations
- **Navigation State**: Managed by React Router's internal state management

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Components are separated for potential lazy loading
- **State Optimization**: Local state management prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Mock Data**: Lightweight mock data structure for demonstration purposes
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS classes ensure optimal performance across devices

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of buttons, links, and navigation elements
- **Color Contrast**: High contrast ratios maintained in both light and dark modes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: React Router Link components provide keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic structure

### Maintainability
- **Component Separation**: Clear separation between homepage and balance functionality
- **Consistent Styling**: Uses existing design system and color palette
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript support maintained throughout all components
- **Code Organization**: Logical file structure in src/components directory

### Scalability
- **Routing Structure**: Easily extensible for additional pages and features
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design allows for easy feature additions
- **State Management**: Local state approach can be upgraded to global state management
- **API Integration**: Mock data structure designed for easy replacement with real API calls

### Security
- **Client-Side Routing**: No sensitive data exposure in routing implementation
- **Mock Data**: No real financial data or API keys in demonstration interface
- **Navigation Security**: Proper use of React Router's secure navigation patterns
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper data sanitization in mock data display
