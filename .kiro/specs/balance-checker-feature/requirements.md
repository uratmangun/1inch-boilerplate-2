# Balance Checker Feature Requirements

## Introduction
The Balance Checker Feature enhances the 1inch-boilerplate landing page by adding a dedicated balance checking interface that allows users to view their DeFi portfolio balances in a mock environment. This feature demonstrates the template's capability to handle multi-page navigation and complex UI components for DeFi applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Balance Navigation Button
**User Story:** As a developer exploring the 1inch-boilerplate template, I want to see a "Check Balance" button on the homepage, so that I can navigate to the balance checking functionality and understand the template's routing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user views the homepage THEN the system SHALL display a "Check Balance" button below the project description paragraph
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Check Balance" button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the balance checking page at route "/balance"
3. WHEN the button is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a wallet icon and use green-to-blue gradient styling consistent with the DeFi theme

### Requirement 2: Multi-Page Routing System
**User Story:** As a developer using the template, I want a proper routing system implemented, so that I can understand how to structure multi-page applications with React Router.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL implement React Router for client-side navigation
2. WHEN a user navigates to "/" THEN the system SHALL display the HomePage component
3. WHEN a user navigates to "/balance" THEN the system SHALL display the BalancePage component
4. WHEN routing is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain proper component separation and clean architecture

### Requirement 3: Balance Checking Interface
**User Story:** As a user exploring the balance checker, I want to see a comprehensive mock portfolio interface, so that I can understand how a real DeFi balance tracker would function.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the balance page THEN the system SHALL display a total portfolio value with aggregated balance
2. WHEN the balance page loads THEN the system SHALL show individual token balance cards for ETH, USDC, 1INCH, and DAI
3. WHEN token balances are displayed THEN the system SHALL include current amounts, USD values, and percentage changes with trend indicators
4. WHEN the interface is shown THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh functionality to simulate balance updates

### Requirement 4: Interactive Balance Features
**User Story:** As a user testing the balance interface, I want interactive features like refresh and mock transactions, so that I can experience a realistic DeFi portfolio management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user clicks the refresh button THEN the system SHALL simulate loading state and update balances with random fluctuations
2. WHEN balances are updated THEN the system SHALL show color-coded positive/negative changes with appropriate trend arrows
3. WHEN the balance page is displayed THEN the system SHALL include a mock transaction history section
4. WHEN transaction history is shown THEN the system SHALL display recent activities like swaps, liquidity additions, and reward claims

### Requirement 5: Navigation and User Experience
**User Story:** As a user navigating between pages, I want consistent design and easy navigation, so that I can seamlessly move between the homepage and balance checker.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user is on the balance page THEN the system SHALL provide a "Back to Home" navigation button
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent design language with the existing 1inch theme
3. WHEN pages are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure responsive design that works on all screen sizes
4. WHEN the interface is used THEN the system SHALL support dark mode throughout all components
