# Pre-commit Hook and Documentation Scraping Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a pre-commit hook system that automatically cleans up code and prettifies it before commits, as well as scraping and storing 1inch API documentation for offline reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pre-commit Code Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unused variables automatically removed and code prettified before each commit, so that code quality is maintained consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer stages files for commit THEN the system SHALL run ESLint with autofix to remove unused variables
2. WHEN a developer stages files for commit THEN the system SHALL run Prettier to format the code
3. WHEN a developer attempts to commit code THEN the system SHALL only allow the commit if all staged files pass the cleanup process

### Requirement 2: Pre-commit Hook Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleanup process integrated with Git's pre-commit hook system, so that I don't need to manually run cleanup commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer installs dependencies THEN the system SHALL set up husky with a pre-commit hook
2. WHEN a developer commits changes THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger lint-staged to process only staged files
3. WHEN the pre-commit hook runs THEN the system SHALL prevent the commit if any staged file fails the cleanup process

### Requirement 3: 1inch API Documentation Scraping

**User Story:** As a developer, I want 1inch API documentation scraped and stored locally, so that I can reference it offline during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the scraping process runs THEN the system SHALL generate llms.txt and llms-full.txt files from the 1inch documentation portal
2. WHEN the scraping process runs THEN the system SHALL save the main overview page as markdown
3. WHEN the scraping process runs THEN the system SHALL map all API documentation URLs and save them as individual markdown files

### Requirement 4: Package Manager Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pre-commit hook to work with the project's package manager configuration, so that it's consistent with existing tooling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pre-commit hook executes THEN the system SHALL use pnpm as the primary package manager
2. WHEN pnpm is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to yarn for executing scripts
3. WHEN package manager commands are executed THEN the system SHALL use fish shell syntax

### Requirement 5: Verification and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the pre-commit hook works correctly, so that I can be confident it will function as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pre-commit hook is set up THEN the system SHALL provide a way to test its functionality
2. WHEN a test commit is made THEN the system SHALL demonstrate that code cleanup occurs automatically
3. WHEN documentation scraping is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that all expected files are saved in the guides directory
